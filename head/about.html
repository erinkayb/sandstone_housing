            <h3>Our Heritage</h3>
            <p>
              Sandstone Housing is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.
              Organized in the late 1960s, Sandstone Housing is an Arizona
              non-profit corporation whose goal was to develop, construct, own,
              maintain, and operate low-income housing projects on the Navajo
              Reservation. In the 1990s, Sandstone Housing was reformed as a
              Navajo corporation with the same goal of helping lower income
              Navajo people. Now, Sandstone Housing has a total of 664 homes and
              apartments in 14 developments across the Navajo Nation.
