        <h2>Multifamily Housing Programs</h2>
        <hr class="hundred" />
        <p>
          Sandstone Housing communities have various programs consisting of
          subsidized and non-subsidized rents. The housing subsidies are paid to
          the property on behalf of the tenants to keep the amount that tenants
          pay for rent affordable. These different programs are implemented
          under very specific eligibility requirements and regulations which
          Sandstone Housing has to adhere. What makes this even more complex is
          that most of Sandstone Housing communities are under more than one
          program, or a combination of programs, depending on the types of loan
          origination and land use restrictions. There are several Agencies that
          monitor these programs, all with different compliance mandates. The
          following information will give you an overview of each program and
          the communities under those specific programs.
