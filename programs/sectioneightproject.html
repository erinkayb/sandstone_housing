				<h2>SECTION 8 PROJECT-BASED HUD PROGRAM (subsidized)</h2>

				<p>HUD-subsidized multifamily properties represent an important and valuable resource in addressing the nationâ€™s affordable housing needs. This is by far the most regulated and complex program since owners have to comply with federal, state, and local laws applicable to the occupancy of multifamily housing properties. Applicants must meet income guidelines depending on the number of people in the household and occupancy standards (a single person cannot rent a four bedroom home). Sandstone Housing requires an applicant to pass a credit check and HUD mandates property owners to conduct criminal background checks to include a search of the National Sex Offender Registry. Once applicants are determined eligible they are placed on a waiting list according to date and time of application and established income levels. Move-in priority is given to those under extremely low income levels. The amount of assistance/subsidy paid on behalf of the tenant and net tenant contribution is calculated by using the household annual income less allowable deductions much like the other programs. Residents are required to recertify annually to ensure they continue to qualify for residency under this program. Arizona Department of Housing is the contract administrator for HUD Arizona. Annual requests for rental increases are submitted to their Contract Coordinator for approval based on the property budget or the published Operating Cost Adjustment Factor (OCAF). New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority is the contract administrator of HUD New Mexico and rental increase requests are submitted to them in the same way.</p>
