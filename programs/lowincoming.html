				<h2>LOW-INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM (non-subsidized)</h2>
				<hr class="hundred" />
				<p><a href="www.housingnm.org">www.housingnm.org</a></p>
				<p>The Tax Credit program provides tax credits to developers and investors for the creation of rental housing affordable to low-income families and individuals. Tax credits provide an incentive for developers and investors by reducing their tax liability. Tax credits can be used to help sponsor new construction or to rehab an existing property of either single family or multifamily rental housing. Tax credit projects must fulfill a minimum 15-year compliance period.Applicantâ€™s (gross) income must fall at or below income guidelines depending on the number of people in the household and must meet occupancy standards. There are no allowable deductions under this program. Sandstone Housing also requires an applicant to pass a credit and criminal background check to include a search of the National Sex Offender Registry. Once an applicant is determined eligible they are placed on a waiting list according to the date and time of application.Housing Credit Income Limits and Maximum Rents are published each year by specific counties. Owners establish the property rents as long as the rents (minus utility allowance) DO NOT exceed the published maximum gross rents for that year for the area. Tenants are required to re-certify each year but remain eligible for continued occupancy even if their income exceeds 140 percent of the applicable income limits.</p>
