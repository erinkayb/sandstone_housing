				<h2>USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT 515 PROGRAM (Subsidized)</h2>
				<hr class="hundred" />
				<p><a href="www.rurdev.usda.gov">www.rurdev.usda.gov</a></p>
				<p>The Section 515 direct loan program provides financing to support the development of rental units in rural areas that need housing affordable for very low, low, and moderate income households, and where this housing is unlikely to be provided through other means. The applicant must meet income guidelines depending on the number of people in the household and occupancy standards (a single person cannot rent a four bedroom home). Sandstone Housing requires an applicant to pass a credit and criminal background check that includes a search of the National Sex Offender Registry. Once an applicant is determined eligible they are placed on a waiting list according to date and time of application and established income level. Move-in priority is given to applicants under the very low income levels, displaced or handicapped status. Rent is determined by (a) verifying combined household income from wages, assets, family assistance, Social Security, pensions, etc. (b) deducting allowances from dependants, handicapped/disabled or elderly status (c) adjusted income is then divided by 12 months and multiplied by 30 percent (d) minus utility allowance for unit size from annual utility analysis report provided by local utility companies (e) finally giving us the net tenant contribution. Residents are required to recertify annually to ensure they continue to qualify for residency under this program. USDA Rural Development approves all rents and rent increases based on the needs of the budget submitted to the Agency on an annual basis.</p>
